# Game Pillars — Party Arena Shooter

## Core Pillars (Non-Negotiable Truths)

1. **Everyone plays almost all the time**
   Players should rarely be forced to spectate. Death leads to fast re-entry, not downtime.

2. **Death is frequent but not punishing**
   Dying is part of normal play. The cost of death is tactical, not emotional.

3. **The arena changes during the match**
   The battlefield starts structured and becomes chaotic through destructible cover.

4. **Speed over strategy**
   Players react more than they plan. Decisions happen in under half a second.

5. **Clarity at a glance**
   A player should understand danger using peripheral vision. Visual readability beats realism.

6. **Chaos escalates naturally**
   Matches begin positional and end frantic without scripted events.

## Anti-Pillars (Illegal Design)

- Long upgrade menus
- Waiting after death
- Memorization-based difficulty
- Camping being optimal strategy
- Hidden mechanics or unclear damage sources
- Slow movement or heavy inertia
- Complex inventory management
- Players eliminated early and forced to watch

If a feature violates a pillar or matches an anti-pillar, it must be redesigned or removed.
